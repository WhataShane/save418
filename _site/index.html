	<a class="spacingx2" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/save-418-saving-the-http-teapot-error-2017-8-1002253556">Below are excerpts from Matt Weinberger's article.</a>

		<span class="header padding2 bold"> > "What the heck is the 418 status code? Why is it important?"</span>

		<p class="spacingx2 q">
			“If you've spent any time browsing the web, chances are pretty good you've run into a page with an error code on it. 
		</p>

		<p class="spacingx2 q">
			You've likely seen numbers 404 ("not found") or 403 ("forbidden").
		</p>

		<p class="spacingx2 q">
			Less commonly spotted is error code 418, which makes your browser proclaim "I'm a teapot."
		</p>

		<p class="spacingx2 q">
			If it sounds like a joke, it is: Way back on April Fool's Day in 1998, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) — a group that sets internet standards — proposed "a protocol for controlling, monitoring, and diagnosing coffee pots." That document defined status 418 thusly: "Any attempt to brew coffee with a teapot should result in the error code '418 I'm a teapot.' The resulting entity body MAY be short and stout."
		</p>

		<p class="spacingx2 q">
			The error code has since become a running gag.
		</p>


				<p class="spacingx2 q">
					Go to Google.com/teapot, and see for yourself. Programming languages like Node.js and Google's Go both include the 418 error as a little Easter egg, as does Microsoft's ASP.NET framework. Someone even rigged a teapot to act as a web server, just so it can proudly display error 418 when you visit it.
				</p>



		<p class="spacingx2 q">
			On Thursday, however, the future of code 418 was briefly called into doubt. In a GitHub thread, Mark Nottingham, the chairman of the IETF working group that oversees hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), argued that the 418 error was never a part of the standard, which governs how web browsers communicate with web servers.
		</p>

    <span class="header padding2 bold"> > "Huh, ok. So why is this running joke important?"</span>

		<p class="spacingx2 q">
			"It’s a reminder that the underlying processes of computers are still made by humans," Brunswick said. "It'd be a real shame to see 418 go."
		</p>

		<p class="spacingx2 q">
			Others pointed out that the teapot status has been treated as a part of HTTP for so long that removing it could actually cause technical problems for many sites. That scored technical points for Brunswick's side.
		</p>

    <span class="header padding2 bold"> > "What was the resolution?"</span>

		<p class="spacingx2 q">
			Ultimately, Nottingham and Brunswick came to an accord that seems to have made everybody happy. Nottingham filed a proposal to adopt 418 as an official HTTP code. If and when it's approved, "I'm a teapot" will officially become a core part of the web.
		</p>

		<p class="spacingx2 q">
			The issue is now closed, with programmers cheering that their teapots are safe. For his part, Nottingham is keeping a healthy sense of humor about the situation. 
"If you ask me, it's a tempest in a ... ah, never mind," Nottingham wrote in an email to Business Insider.
